#JAVASCRIPT TEST 0001 – Star Pattern

This project contains a JavaScript program that prints a diamond-like star pattern using **nested loops**.  
It evaluates understanding of:

- Nested loops  
- Spacing and alignment  
- Pattern construction and output formatting
  ## how it Works
1. **Two main loops**:
   - Upper half of the pattern  
   - Lower half of the pattern  

2. **Nested loops**:
   - Leading spaces  
   - Stars  
   - Spaces between stars  

3. Upper half: leading spaces decrease, spaces between stars increase `(2*i-3)`  
4. Lower half: leading spaces increase, spaces between stars decrease `(2*i-3)`  

5. Each row is printed using `console.log(row)`.
